# **Dimensionality Reduction Analysis for Multi-Disease Prediction Models**  

### 📌 **Overview**  
This project explores the impact of dimensionality reduction techniques on the performance of different machine learning models for disease prediction. It utilizes five real-world medical datasets from Kaggle and evaluates five predictive models with five decomposition methods. The results are compared through graphical analysis to identify the best-performing approach.

## 📊 **Datasets Used**  
The project uses five publicly available medical datasets from Kaggle:  

1. **Breast Cancer Dataset** (`breast_cancer.csv`)  
2. **Parkinson's Disease Dataset** (`parkinsons.csv`)  
3. **Diabetes Dataset** (`diabetes dataset.csv`)  
4. **Lung Cancer Dataset** (`lung cancer.csv`)  
5. **Heart Disease Dataset** (`heart.csv`)  

Each dataset contains medical features that are used to classify whether a patient has the respective disease or not.  

---

## ⚙️ **Machine Learning Models**  
The following models are used to classify diseases based on extracted features:  

1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
2. **Random Forest (RF)**  
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
4. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
5. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**  

---

## 🔍 **Dimensionality Reduction Methods**  
To reduce feature space and improve model performance, five decomposition techniques are applied:  

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
2. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**  
3. **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**  
4. **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**  
5. **Factor Analysis**  

---

## 📈 **Performance Comparison**  
- Each model is trained and tested on the original and reduced datasets.  
- Accuracy are recorded.  
- Results are compared visually using **matplotlib** plots.  
- The final graphs illustrate how dimensionality reduction impacts model performance across datasets.
